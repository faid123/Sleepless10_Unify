Game Concept:
In a gloomy city overrun by an evil unicorn, you’ve descended upon it as a unicorn, a saviour to all its residents.
However, the city’s defense force has something else to say about the goals of saving the town.
It is time to brighten up all their worthless lives, and to Unify this city!

How to play:
You play as a unicorn looking to UNIFY the town with special coloring weapons.
Shoot buildings and enemies to "damage" them, after a certain number of hits, they will
gain color and they will be unified.

The bottom left bar represents your health, get hit too many times and it's game over.
The bar below the health bar represents the power bar, when you unify buildings,
they drop these cubes that can be picked up. The cubes will accumulate and fill up the power
bar. Once full, the player gains rapid fire rate and can go ham on the enemies and buildings. 
The bottom right UI represents the weapon that is being selected as well as the
number that selects each weapon. The minimap on the top left is to help the player navigate
the level and to show enemies which have spawned.

In the first stage, the player only have access to the pistol. As the game plays on, the player can colour buildings to
increase the threat level, or they can explore the town to complete certain objectives. Upon completion, the threat level increases by one full level (levels are noted by the rainbow icons)
Once the threat level reaches level 5, the player will encounter the boss of the first stage. Once the player has defeated the
boss, another cutscene will play, showing the player has earned a new weapon.

Currently, the player has to manually exit the first stage by pressing ESC and return to main menu. At the main menu, the player
can select the Level Select menu and select the second stage manually. Upon entering the second stage, new models and skybox
will show that the player is in another new stage. The player also has access to the laser weapon. The same
thing applies: complete the objectives and reach threat level 5, then defeat the boss to proceed to level 3.

Once in level 3, the player has attained the rocket launcher and has all weapons available to him. Once again,
reach threat level 5 and defeat the final boss to complete the whole game.
